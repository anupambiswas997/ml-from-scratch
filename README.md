# Understanding Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project is a simple C++ implementation of machine learning models, for understanding ML theory. Hence the main objective behind this repository is educational. The focus, at least initially will not be on writing optimized code for the algorithms involved, but to delve deep into the mathematic details of different machine learning approaches. The belief is that it will allow for investigation and understanding of what goes on in the internal solution finding processes of the algortithms.
